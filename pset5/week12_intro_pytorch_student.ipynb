If we were not using a deep learning framework like PyTorch, we would have to go through and derive all the gradients ourselves by hand, then code them into our training pipeline.

To construct an optimizer you must provide an iterable containing the model parameters to optimize. This can be done by calling the `parameters()` method of our model (a method that is inherited from `torch.nn.Module`). Then, you can specify optimizer-specific options such as the learning rate and weight decay. For many deep learning applications, standard [stochastic gradient descent](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/sgd.html) (SGD) optimizes models during training quite well.

        "Similarly to how we previously defined our logistic regression model by using PyTorch's object-oriented style, we can implement a neural network/[multi-layer perceptron](https://machinelearningmastery.com/neural-networks-crash-course/) (MLP) with just a few tweaks. Instead of just one `Linear` layer, this time we'll use two. Additionally, after the first `Linear` layer we'll apply a non-linear [activation function](https://machinelearningmastery.com/choose-an-activation-function-for-deep-learning/). Activation functions are a critical part of neural network design, and help give our neural network model added expressivity for modelling complex, non-linear relationships. The de facto nonlinearity used in neural networks is the [rectified linear unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)) (ReLU). We can implement this ReLU activation function as a layer in our MLP by using PyTorch's [`torch.nn.ReLU`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.ReLU.html) layer.\n",

While this added complexity gives our model the capacity to learn more complex, non-linear relationships, we must now also be weary of [overfitting](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/overfitting). Overfitting occurs when a model learns the information represented in training data to the point where it's performance on hold-out data is negatively influenced. Deep learning models can have millions (sometimes [billions](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/openai-presents-gpt-3-a-175-billion-parameters-language-model/)!) of trainable parameters, which means that the number of model parameters can be greater than the number of data points on which the model is trained. These \"over-parametrized\" models can be prone to overfitting, especially in cases of small data. Here, we're hoping that our test accuracy is similar to our training accuracy of around 96%-97%. As we'll see, our model did not overfit the training set and achieves a comparable test set accuracy.\n"
